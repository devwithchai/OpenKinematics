# OpenKinematics

> An educational Python library for robot kinematics built from first principles.

OpenKinematics is an open-source Python library that implements fundamental
robot kinematics algorithms from scratch using only NumPy and Matplotlib.

The project is designed to bridge robotics theory and software engineering by
providing clean, readable implementations of forward kinematics, Jacobians,
inverse kinematics, and robot visualization. Rather than treating robotics
algorithms as black boxes, OpenKinematics focuses on helping students,
educators, and developers understand how these algorithms work while exposing
them through a simple and consistent API.

## Why OpenKinematics?

Many robotics libraries prioritize industrial applications and hide the
underlying mathematics behind large software frameworks. OpenKinematics takes a
different approach.

It is designed as an educational library where every major algorithm is
implemented from first principles, thoroughly documented, and organized using a
clean layered architecture. The goal is to make robotics mathematics easier to
understand while demonstrating how those algorithms can be structured as a
maintainable software library.

In addition to being a usable robotics library, OpenKinematics is intended to
serve as a learning resource for students, educators, and developers who want
to understand how robotics algorithms translate into clean, maintainable
software.

## Installation

### Requirements

- Python 3.10 or later
- NumPy 1.24 or later
- Matplotlib 3.7 or later

OpenKinematics is currently installed directly from the source repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/devwithchai/OpenKinematics.git

cd OpenKinematics

pip install -e .
```

---

## Quick Start

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from open_kinematics.api import Robot

robot = Robot.planar([1.0, 1.0])

joint_values = [0.5, 0.3]

transform = robot.fk(joint_values)

print(transform)

robot.plot(joint_values)

plt.show()
```

For more complete examples covering forward kinematics, inverse kinematics, and
visualization, see the programs in the `examples/` directory.

## Examples

OpenKinematics includes complete, runnable example programs demonstrating the
library's public API and supported robot models.

| Example | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `examples/planar_fk_ik.py` | Forward kinematics, geometric inverse kinematics, round-trip verification, and 2D visualization for a two-link planar manipulator. |
| `examples/scara_fk_ik.py` | Forward kinematics, geometric inverse kinematics, and 2D visualization for a SCARA robot. |
| `examples/articulated_fk_ik.py` | Forward kinematics, numerical pseudoinverse inverse kinematics, full-pose verification, and 3D visualization for an articulated robot. |

Each example is self-contained and demonstrates the recommended usage of the
public `Robot` facade API.

## Supported Robot Models

OpenKinematics currently supports the following robot manipulators:

| Robot | Forward Kinematics | Jacobian | Inverse Kinematics | Visualization |
|--------|-------------------|----------|--------------------|---------------|
| Planar (2R) | ✅ | ✅ | Geometric | 2D |
| SCARA (RRP-R) | ✅ | ✅ | Geometric | 2D |
| Articulated (6-DOF) | ✅ | ✅ | Numerical Pseudoinverse | 3D |

## Project Architecture

The library follows a layered architecture where higher-level modules depend
only on lower-level modules.

                +----------v-----------+
                |        NumPy         |
                +----------------------+
```

This dependency direction is intentionally enforced throughout the project to
keep the codebase modular, maintainable, and easy to extend.
